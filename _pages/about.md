Dr. Sildomar Monteiro is a senior research engineer with [Aurora Flight Sciences](http://www.aurora.aero/){:target="_blank"}' Autonomy Research Division since 2020. He is focused on researching and applying robotics, machine learning, and computer vision algorithms to develop fully autonomous aircraft. Prior to joining Aurora, he was a senior research scientist at Boeing Research & Technology's AI Technology team. Until 2017, he was an assistant professor of robotics at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/electrical/){:target="_blank"}, where he lead the Intelligent Sensing and Robotics Lab. His lab's research focused on machine learning for image understanding and multisensor fusion from remote sensing and unmanned ground vehicles. Prior to RIT, he was a research fellow in the [Australian Centre for Field Robotics](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html){:target="_blank"}, University of Sydney, where he conducted research on machine learning for robot perception and hyperspectral analysis for fully autonomous mining.

Dr. Monteiro earned a Ph.D. in engineering from the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/){:target="_blank"}, Japan. He went on to earn a prestigious Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2007. He has published over 60 peer-reviewed papers in academic journals and conferences. He served as a Guest Editor of the [Journal of Field Robotics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15564967){:target="_blank"} in 2013, and was a program Co-Chair of the Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation in 2009.
