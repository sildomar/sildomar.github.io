Dr. Sildomar Monteiro is a senior research scientist with [Aurora Flight Sciences](http://www.aurora.aero/){:target="_blank"}' Autonomy Research Division since 2020. He is a principal investigator and program manager for research projects in collaboration with MIT and CMU, funded by the DoD. He is focused on researching and applying advanced artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics algorithms for technical challenges in aerospace and defense. Prior to Aurora, he was a senior research scientist at [Boeing Research & Technology](https://www.boeing.com/innovation/){:target="_blank"}'s AI Technology team. Before joining Boeing, he was an assistant professor of robotics at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/electrical/){:target="_blank"}, where he lead the Intelligent Sensing and Robotics Lab. Prior to RIT, he was a research fellow in the [Australian Centre for Field Robotics](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html){:target="_blank"} at the University of Sydney.

Dr. Monteiro earned a Ph.D. in engineering from the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/){:target="_blank"}, Japan. He went on to earn a prestigious Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2007. He has published over 60 peer-reviewed papers in academic journals and conferences.
