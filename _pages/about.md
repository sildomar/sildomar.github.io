Dr. Sildomar Monteiro is an advanced technologist with [Boeing Research](http://www.boeing.com/innovation/){:target="_blank"}'s Artificial Intelligence team. He is focused on researching and applying machine learning, robotics and computer vision algorithms to technical challenges at Boeing. Prior to joining Boeing, he was an assistant professor of robotics at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/electrical/){:target="_blank"}, where he conducted research on machine learning for image understanding and multisensor fusion from remote sensing and unmanned ground vehicles. Prior to RIT, he was a research fellow in the [Australian Centre for Field Robotics](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html){:target="_blank"}, University of Sydney, where he conducted research on machine learning for robot perception and hyperspectral analysis for fully autonomous mines.

Dr. Monteiro earned a Ph.D. in engineering from the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/){:target="_blank"}, Japan, in 2007. He went on to earn a prestigious Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2007. He has published over 50 peer-reviewed papers in academic journals and conferences. He served as a Guest Editor of the [Journal of Field Robotics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15564967){:target="_blank"} in 2013, and was a program Co-Chair of the Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation in 2009.
