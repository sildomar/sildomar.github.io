<span id="_Toc311556126" class="anchor"></span>RESEARCH INTERESTS

> My research interests are in artificial intelligence and machine
> learning. I am especially interested in applications in robotics,
> computer vision, and remote sensing. My recent publications have
> focused on deep learning and probabilistic graphical models for
> multi-sensor data analysis from aerial and ground vehicles. My passion
> is for creating fully autonomous systems that augment human abilities.
