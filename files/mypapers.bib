  Abstract                 = {Undirected graphical models have been successfully used to jointly model the spatial and the spectral dependencies in earth observing hyperspectral images. They produce less noisy, smooth, and spatially coherent land-cover maps and give top accuracies on many datasets. Moreover, they can easily be combined with other state-of-the-art approaches, such as deep learning. This has made them an essential tool for remote-sensing researchers and practitioners. However, graphical models have not been easily accessible to the larger remote-sensing community as they are not discussed in standard remote-sensing textbooks and not included in the popular remote-sensing software and toolboxes. In this tutorial, we provide a theoretical introduction to Markov random fields and conditional random fields-based spatialâ€“spectral classification for land-cover mapping along with a detailed step-by-step practical guide on applying these methods using freely available software. Furthermore, the discussed methods are benchmarked on four public hyperspectral datasets for a fair comparison among themselves and easy comparison with the vast number of methods in literature which use the same datasets. The source code necessary to reproduce all the results in the paper is published on-line to make it easier for the readers to apply these techniques to different remote-sensing problems.}

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper describes an application of adaptive sampling to geology modeling with a view of improving the operational cost and efficiency in certain surface mining applications. The objectives are to minimize the number of blast holes drilled into, and the accidental penetrations of, the geological boundary of interest. These objectives are driven by economic considerations as the cost is, firstly, directly proportional to the number of holes drilled and secondly, related to the efficiency of target material recovery associated with excavation and blast damage. The problem formulation is therefore motivated by the incentive to learn more about the lithology and drill less. The principal challenge with building an accurate surface model is that the sedimentary rock mass is coarsely sampled by drilling exploration holes which are typically a long distance apart. Thus, interpolation does not capture adequately local changes in the underlying geology. With the recent advent of consistent and reliable real-time identification of geological boundaries under field conditions using measure-while-drilling data, we pose the local model estimation problem in an adaptive sampling framework. The proposed sampling strategy consists of two phases. First, blast-holes are drilled to the geological boundary of interest, and their locations are adaptively selected to maximize utility in terms of the incremental improvement that can be made to the evolving spatial model. The second phase relies on the predicted geology and drills to an expert based pre-specified standoff distance from the geological boundary of interest, to optimize blasting and minimize its damage. Using data acquired from a coal mine survey bench in Australia, we demonstrate that adaptively choosing blast-holes in Phase 1 can minimize the total number of holes drilled to the top of the coal seam, as opposed to random hole selection, whilst optimizing blasting by maintaining a reasonable compromise in the error in the stopping distances from the seam. We also show that adaptive sampling requires, for accurate estimation, only a fraction of the holes that were initially drilled for this particular dataset.},

A novel method of Reinforcement Learning (RL), Gaussian Process Dynamic Programming (GPDP), yields promising results for closed-loop control of a low-cost manipulator however research surrounding most RL techniques lack breadth of comparable experiments into the viability of particular learning techniques on equivalent environments. We introduce several model-based learning agents as mechanisms to control a noisy, low-cost robotic system. The agents were tested in a simulated domain for learning closed-loop policies of a simple task with no prior information. Then, the fidelity of the simulations is confirmed by application of GPDP to a physical system.},

In order to extract the human skin correctly, we focus on the training of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) by the hyperspectral data. From the standpoint of avoiding the over-fitting problem generated by multi-channel inputs of the hyper-spectral data, it is necessary to be trained by the optimal bands. In this paper, we propose the coupled search method for the optimal number and combination of bands in order to extract the target from the hyperspectral data. The coupled search method is composed of two search methods. The first is a new search method of the maximum value of the evaluation function which searches the optimal number of bands from the non-training data. The other is the search method using the Particle Swarm Optimization which searched the optimal combination of bands from the training data. The ANN is trained by the selected combination of bands, and the results are evaluated. Moreover, the trained network obtained using the coupled search method is compared with the ANN trained by all the bands and the Normalized Difference Human Index.},

Hyperspectral images that are correlated spatially and spectrally provide ample information across the bands to benefit this purpose. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are discriminative models that carry several advantages over conventional techniques: no requirement of the independence assumption for observations, flexibility in defining local and pairwise potentials, and an independence between the modules of feature selection and parameter leaning. In this paper we present a framework for classifying remotely sensed imagery based on CRFs. We apply a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to raw remotely sensed imagery data in order to generate more meaningful feature potentials to the CRFs model. This approach produces promising results when tested with publicly available AVIRIS Indian Pine imagery.},

High resolution range profiles (HRRPs) were used as the feature vectors with minimal pre-processing. Training and test datasets were generated by rotating the targets in the azimuth plane. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted, as well as precision, recall, and accuracy measures derived, and confusion matrices obtained for each classifier under a specific operating point. It was found that the traditional correlation approach performed best under the given circumstances, closely followed by the two SVM approaches and naive Bayes.

  Abstract                 = {During a surgery, the inevitable presence of blood covering the surgical field demands efforts to keep the area as clean as possible. A new hyperspectral data processing method is being developed to deliver clearer images to the surgeon. The analysis of optical absorption properties of the blood and water indicates that, between the visible and near infrared spectral regions, some valuable information under the blood layer may be obtained using a spectral imaging system. We propose a neural network approach to provide a nonlinear combination of spectral band reflectance in order to reveal images that could not be seeing with unprocessed images. This paper describes the implementation of single-layer and multi-layer perceptron architectures to perform the hyperspectral data processing. We present experimental results attesting the viability of the proposed method. We demonstrate that hyperspectral imagery can be exploited
as visual aid for surgical guidance.},

Boosting decision trees is an efficient and accurate classification technique that has been applied successfully to process hyperspectral data. The learned structure of the trees can provide insight about which bands are more relevant for the classification. We develop a method that takes into account the improvement obtained by each split of the tree ensemble and calculates a relative importance measure of the input features.

The base classifiers included in this study are: boosted decision trees, support vector machines and logistic regression. The standard algorithm for some of these methods provides a non-probabilistic, hard decision as output. For those methods, posterior class probability estimates were approximated by fitting a sigmoid function to the classifier predictions. To perform multi-class classification, a one-versus-all approach was used. The different methods were compared using hyperspectral data acquired from ore-bearing rocks under different environmental conditions. The calibration of class probabilities improved the overall performance for almost all algorithms tested; an improvement of over 10% was observed in some cases.},

Two variants of boosting, GentleBoost and LogitBoost, were implemented and compared with support vector machines as benchmark. Two pre-processing transformations that may improve classification accuracy were investigated: derivative analysis and smoothing, both calculated by the Savitzky-Golay method. To assess the performance of the algorithms over noisy data, white Gaussian noise was added at various levels to the data set.

While there have been studies relating such measurement-while-drilling (MWD) parameters to rock properties, none of them has attempted to model context, that is, to associate local measurements with measurements obtained in neighbouring regions. This paper proposes a novel approach to infer geology from drill measurements by incorporating spatial relationships through a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework. A boosting algorithm is used as a local classifier mapping drill measurements to corresponding geological categories. The CRF then uses this local information in conjunction with neighbouring measurements to jointly reason about their categories. Model parameters are learned from training data by maximizing the pseudo-likelihood. The probability distribution of classified borehole sections is calculated using belief propagation. We present experimental results of applying the method to MWD data collected from a semi-autonomous drill rig at an iron ore mine in Western Australia.},

We propose a novel application of hyperspectral imagery in the biomedical field. We conceived a method to exploit the capabilities of hyperspectral imaging systems in order to provide clearer images of areas covered by blood to the surgeon. We developed a neural network approach to generate a nonlinear combination of spectral reflectance bands in the near infrared region revealing images that could not be seeing in unprocessed images. The experimental results are compared with conventional image processing techniques. We present in vitro experiments using human blood and in situ experiments using guinea pigs to attest the validity of the proposed method.},

The objective of the algorithm is to extract the features that generate the best visualization of an area covered by blood. The proposed method uses a binary version of a particle swarm optimizer to select a subset of band wavelengths in the near-infrared region, in which the optical absorption characteristics of blood allows some visual information to be extracted. A linear image transformation is subsequently applied to the selected features. Two transformation equations were tested, for the selection of three and four bands. The transformed image was then evaluated using four different fitness criteria: entropy, Euclidean distance, contrast and correlation. We present experimental results using human blood and an artificial background to validate the method and assess the fitness functions. The entropy better evaluated the amount of visual information under the layer of blood. The four-bands transformation produced higher fitness values and better visualization. The enhanced images of the extracted features revealed good visualizations under the layer of spilled blood.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses one of the key components of the mining process: the geological prediction of natural resources from spatially distributed measurements. We present a novel approach combining undirected graphical models with ensemble classifiers to provide 3D geological models from multiple sensors installed in an autonomous drill rig. Drill sensor measurements used for drilling automation, known as measurement-while-drilling (MWD) data, have the potential to provide an estimate of the geological properties of the rocks being drilled. The proposed method maps MWD parameters to rock types while considering spatial relationships, i.e., associating measurements obtained from neighboring regions. We use a conditional random field with local information provided by boosted decision trees to jointly reason about the rock categories of neighboring measurements. To validate the approach, MWD data was collected from a drill rig operating at an iron ore mine. Graphical models of the 3D structure present in real data sets possess a high number of nodes, edges and cycles, making them intractable for exact inference. We provide a comparison of three approximate inference methods to calculate the most probable distribution of class labels. The empirical results demonstrate the benefits of spatial modeling through graphical models to improve classification performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Hyperspectral imagery is used to map the distribution of iron and separate iron ore from shale (a waste product) on a vertical mine face in an open-pit mine in the Pilbara, Western Australia. Vertical mine faces have complex surface geometries which cause large spatial variations in the amount of incident and reflected light. Methods used to analyse imagery must minimise these effects whilst preserving any spectral variations between rock types and minerals. Derivative analysis of spectra to the 1st-, 2nd- and 4th-order is used to do this. To quantify the relative amounts and distribution of iron, the derivative spectrum is integrated across the visible and near infrared spectral range (430-970 nm) and over those wavelength regions containing individual peaks and troughs associated with specific iron absorption features. As a test of this methodology, results from laboratory spectra acquired from representative rock samples were compared with total amounts of iron minerals from X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Relationships between derivatives integrated over the visible near-infrared range and total amounts (% weight) of iron minerals were strongest for the 4th- and 2nd-derivative (R2= 0.77 and 0.74, respectively) and weakest for the 1st-derivative (R2= 0.56). Integrated values of individual peaks and troughs showed moderate to strong relationships in 2nd- (R2= 0.68-0.78) and 4th-derivative (R2= 0.49-0.78) spectra. The weakest relationships were found for peaks or troughs towards longer wavelengths. The same derivative methods were then applied to imagery to quantify relative amounts of iron minerals on a mine face. Before analyses, predictions were made about the relative abundances of iron in the different geological zones on the mine face, as mapped from field surveys. Integration of the whole spectral curve (430-970 nm) from the 2nd- and 4th-derivative gave results which were entirely consistent with predictions. Conversely, integration of the 1st-derivative gave results that did not fit with predictions nor distinguish between zones with very large and small amounts of iron oxide. Classified maps of ore and shale were created using a simple level-slice of the 1st-derivative reflectance at 702, 765 and 809 nm. Pixels classified as shale showed a similar distribution to kaolinite (an indicator of shales in the region), as mapped by the depth of the diagnostic kaolinite absorption feature at 2196 nm. Standard statistical measures of classification performance (accuracy, precision, recall and the Kappa coefficient of agreement) indicated that nearly all of the pixels were classified correctly using 1st-derivative reflectance at 765 and 809 nm. These results indicate that data from the VNIR (430-970 nm) can be used to quantify, without a priori knowledge, the total amount of iron minerals and to distinguish ore from shale on vertical mine faces.},

  Abstract                 = {Hyperspectral data acquired from field-based platforms present new challenges for their analysis, particularly for complex vertical surfaces exposed to large changes in the geometry and intensity of illumination. The use of hyperspectral data to map rock types on a vertical mine face is demonstrated, with a view to providing real-time information for automated mining applications. The performance of two classification techniques, namely, spectral angle mapper (SAM) and support vector machines (SVMs), is compared rigorously using a spectral library acquired under various conditions of illumination. SAM and SVM are then applied to a mine face, and results are compared with geological boundaries mapped in the field. Effects of changing conditions of illumination, including shadow, were investigated by applying SAM and SVM to imagery acquired at different times of the day. As expected, classification of the spectral libraries showed that, on average, SVM gave superior results for SAM, although SAM performed better where spectra were acquired under conditions of shadow. In contrast, when applied to hypserspectral imagery of a mine face, SVM did not perform as well as SAM. Shadow, through its impact upon spectral curve shape and albedo, had a profound impact on classification using SAM and SVM.},

To evaluate this, we focus on the ferric iron crystal field absorption, located at about 900 nm (F900), because it is impacted by both environmental and sensor effects. The consistency with which the wavelength position of F900 can be determined from imagery acquired in laboratory and field settings is evaluated under artificial and natural illumination, respectively. The wavelength position of F900, determined from laboratory imagery, is also evaluated as an indicator of the proportion of goethite in mixtures of crushed rock. Results are compared with those from a high-resolution field spectrometer. Images describing the wavelength position of F900 showed large amounts of spatial variability and contained an artifact-a consistent shift in the wavelength position of F900 to longer wavelengths. These effects were greatly reduced or removed when wavelength position was determined from a polynomial fit to the data, enabling wavelength position to be used to map hematite and goethite in samples of ore and on a vertical surface (a mine face). The wavelength position of F900 from a polynomial fit was strongly positively correlated with the proportion of goethite (R2=0.97). Taken together, these findings indicate that the wavelength position of absorption features from VNIR imagery should be determined from a polynomial (or equivalent) fit to the original data and not from the original data themselves.},

  Abstract                 = {Perception based on the most commonly used sensors such as visual cameras and laser range finders (or LIDARs) has enabled major achievements in field robotics. Stanley and Boss won DARPA Grand Challenges using almost exclusively cameras and LIDARs (albeit many of them). The Opportunity rover, using only cameras for navigation, recently broke the off-Earth driving record, with a distance of more than 40km. However, the capabilities of state-of-the-art robotic systems have remained largely restricted by the intrinsic limitations of these sensors. Boss' conquest of the DARPA Urban Challenge was temporarily compromised by the detection of a dust cloud by one of its LIDARs. Opportunity's glorious run came close to a premature ending when its cameras proved insufficient to predict that its wheels would get stuck in a sand dune that looked identical to many traversed thus far. These traditional sensors have often become insufficient when developing autonomous platforms that should operate for extended periods of time and in ever more challenging environments and conditions, e.g. limited visibility due to dust or fog. Complex and varied robotic applications may also require richer environment models than can be generated with only these traditional sensors. All these considerations have led to increased interest in alternative sensing modalities in recent years. To sense the environment, alternative sensors use physical principles that are distinct from those used by traditional robotic sensors, and may operate at various electromagnetic frequencies outside the visible spectrum. Examples include radars of various types, thermal cameras, hyperspectral and multispectral cameras, and sonars. The use of these sensors for robotic perception has allowed robots to operate in conditions that were previously infeasible and had to be avoided. Robots can navigate through smoke or at night with infrared imaging, or track roads in a dust storm using millimeter-wave radars. This sensory capability has also opened up a number of new robotic applications (e.g., automatic geological analysis using hyperspectral cameras, sonar mapping of oil rigs, eddy current inspection of nuclear boilers), in which alternative sensors are often combined with traditional robotic sensors to provide enhanced discrimination power and higher perception integrity. This special issue presents outstanding results on novel robotic perception concepts motivated by the use of alternative sensing in challenging applications and environments.},

  Abstract                 = {Hyperspectral image data has great potential to identify and classify the chemical composition of materials remotely. Factors limiting the use of hyperspectral sensors in practical land-based applications, such as robotics and mining, are the complexity and cost of data acquisition, and the processing time required for the subsequent analysis. This is mainly due to the high dimensional and high volume nature of hyperspectral image data. In this paper, we propose to combine a feature selection method, based on particle swarm optimization (PSO), with a kernel method, support vector machines (SVM), to reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral data for classification. We evaluate several different kernels, including some optimized for hyperspectral analysis. In particular, a recent kernel called observation angle dependent (OAD) kernel, originally designed for Gaussian Process regression, was extended for SVM classification. The SVM with the optimized kernel was then applied to induce the feature selection of a binary version of PSO. We validate the method using hyperspectral data sets acquired of rock samples from Western Australia. The empirical results demonstrate that our method is able to efficiently reduce the number of features while keeping, or even improving, the performance of the SVM classifier.},

When characterizing rock types from drill performance data, the main challenge is that there is not an obvious one-to-one correspondence between the two. In this paper, a hybrid rock recognition approach is proposed which combines Gaussian Process (GP) regression with clustering. Drill performance data is also known as Measurement While Drilling (MWD) data and a rock hardness measure - Adjusted Penetration Rate (APR) is extracted using the raw data in discrete drill holes. GP regression is then applied to create a more dense APR distribution, followed by clustering which produces discrete class labels. No initial labelling is needed. Comparisons are made with alternative measures of rock hardness from MWD data as well as state-of-the-art GP classification. Experimental results from an actual mine site show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

The major difficulty lies in that there is not a clear one to one correspondence between the mechanical measurements and the rock type due to the mechanical noise as well as the variety of the rock geology. This paper proposes a novel wavelet feature space projection approach to robustly classify rock types from drilling data with Gaussian Process classification. Instead of applying Gaussian Process classifier directly to the given measurement pieces, a group of wavelet features are extracted from the neighboring region of a specific data point. Gaussian Process classification is then carried out on the new extracted wavelet features. By putting neighboring data points into consideration rather than dealing with each data point individually, the underlying pattern can be better captured and more robust to noise and data variations. Experimental results on synthetic data as well as varied real world drilling data have shown the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract  = {Probabilistic graphical models have strong potential for use in hyperspectral image classification. One important class of probabilisitic graphical models is the Conditional Random Field (CRF), which has distinct advantages over traditional Markov Random Fields (MRF), including: no independence assumption is made over the observation, and local and pairwise potential features can be defined with flexibility. Conventional methods for hyperspectral image classification utilize all spectral bands and assign the corresponding raw intensity values into the feature functions in CRFs. These methods, however, require significant computational efforts and yield an ambiguous summary from the data. To mitigate these problems, we propose a novel processing method for hyperspectral image classification by incorporating a lower dimensional representation into the CRFs. In this paper, we use representations based on three types of graph-based dimensionality reduction algorithms: Laplacian Eigemaps (LE), Spatial-Spectral Schroedinger Eigenmaps (SSSE), and Local Linear Embedding (LLE), and we investigate the impact of choice of representation on the subsequent CRF-based classifications.},

  abstract  = {Changes in vegetation cover, building construction, road network and traffic conditions caused by urban expansion affect the human habitat as well as the natural environment in rapidly developing cities. It is crucial to assess these changes and respond accordingly by identifying man-made and natural structures with accurate classification algorithms. With the increase in use of multi-sensor remote sensing systems, researchers are able to obtain a more complete description of the scene of interest. By utilizing multi-sensor data, the accuracy of classification algorithms can be improved. In this paper, we propose a method for combining 3D LiDAR point clouds and high-resolution color images to classify urban areas using Gaussian processes (GP). GP classification is a powerful non-parametric classification method that yields probabilistic classification results. It makes predictions in a way that addresses the uncertainty of real world. In this paper, we attempt to identify man-made and natural objects in urban areas including buildings, roads, trees, grass, water and vehicles. LiDAR features are derived from the 3D point clouds and the spatial and color features are extracted from RGB images. For classification, we use the Laplacian approximation for GP binary classification on the new combined feature space. The multiclass classification has been implemented by using one-vs-all binary classification strategy. The result of applying support vector machines (SVMs) and logistic regression (LR) classifier is also provided for comparison. Our experiments show a clear improvement of classification results by using the two sensors combined instead of each sensor separately. Also we found the advantage of applying GP approach to handle the uncertainty in classification result without compromising accuracy compared to SVM, which is considered as the state-of-the-art classification method.},

  abstract  = {The increasing availability of very-high- resolution(VHR) aerial optical images as well as coregistered LiDAR data opens great opportunities for improving object-level dense semantic labeling of airborne remote sensing imagery. As a result, efficient and effective multisensor fusion techniques are demanded in order to fully exploit the two complementary data modalities.Recent efforts have been mostly devoted to exploring how to properly combine both sensor data using pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) at the feature level. In this paper, we propose a decision-level fusion approach with a simpler architecture for the task of dense semantic labeling. Our proposed method first obtains two initial probabilistic labeling results from a fully-convolutional neural network and a simple classifier, e.g. logistic regression exploiting spectral channels andLiDAR data, respectively. These two outcomes are then combined within a higher-order conditional random field(CRF). The CRF inference will estimate the final dense semantic labeling results. Higher-order CRFs modeling helps to resolve the fusion ambiguities by explicitly using the spatial contexture information, which can be learned from the data itself. Based on the experiments on the ISPRS 2D semantic labeling Potsdam dataset, our proposed approach compares favorably or outperforms the state-of- the-art baseline methods that utilize feature level fusion.},

In order to obtain an optimized classier, following aspects are rather challenging: 1) complexity in dealing with the overwhelming amount of data information from an advanced high resolution hyperspectral imaging sensor; 2) difficulty in leveraging spectral and spatial information across the sensed wavelengths; 3) struggles in obtaining adequate dataset as in the same modalities with labeled ground truth in the training process. Therefore, we propose a novel classification approach to tackle these issues by utilizing probabilistic graphical model on super-pixel segmentation. This method is capable of compacting hyperspectral information efficiently which decreases computing complexity. Moreover, the employment of probabilistic graphical models that weighs the strong dependency in spatial and spectral neighbors improves accuracy. One of the most successful probabilistic graphical models is Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Conventional methods utilize all spectral bands and assign the corresponding raw intensity values into the feature functions in CRFs and build the grid graph. These methods, however, require significant computational efforts and yield an ambiguous summary from the data. To mitigate these problems, we cooperate a non-linear kernel based classier to provide the meaningful probability features for CRFs and learn the non-grid graph from super pixel segmentation.},

Therefore, the object detection is usually formalized as a supervised classification task. In this paper, we propose to apply the Gaussian process (GP) classification algorithm for our detection problem. Among different classifiers, the GP classifier is a Bayesian classification method that is able to make estimations in a probabilistic way. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, we experiment the proposed framework with different feature extraction schemes and classification methods. We carry out a cross-validation experiment over an image dataset that consists of objects and non-objects to train an object detector, and apply the trained detector in an unobserved image scene to search for the objects of interest. Our results show that the GP classifier is competitive to support vector machines (SVM), which is considered state-of-the-art.},

  abstract  = {With rapid developments in satellite and sensor technologies, increasing amount of high spatial resolution aerial images have become available. Classification of these images are important for many remote sensing image understanding tasks, such as image retrieval and object detection. Meanwhile, image classification in the computer vision field is revolutionized with recent popularity of the convolutional neural networks (CNN), based on which the state-of-the-art classification results are achieved. Therefore, the idea of applying the CNN for high resolution aerial image classification is straightforward. However, it is not trivial mainly because the amount of labeled images in remote sensing for training a deep neural network is limited. As a result, transfer learning techniques were adopted for this problem, where the CNN used for the classification problem is pre-trained on a larger dataset beforehand. In this paper, we propose a specific fine-tuning strategy that results in better CNN models for aerial image classification. Extensive experiments were carried out using the proposed approach with different CNN architectures. Our proposed method shows competitive results compared to the existing approaches, indicating the superiority of the proposed fine-tuning algorithm.},
